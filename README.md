# opsiscript syntax highlighting for vim

This vim plugin provides basic syntax highlighting for opsiscript
(https://opsi.org). It is (probably) neither perfect nor complete.

If you don't already have a plugin manager you can use this by cloning the
repository to `~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/` (all plugins in `start` will be
automatically loaded at startup):
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/
git clone https://github.com/janheini/opsi-syntax.vim \
        ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/opsi-syntax.vim
```
